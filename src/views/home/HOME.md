# Home Structure

## Files
- `Home.jsx` - main home page component
- `HeroSection/` - hero slider with multiple slides and buttons
- `CarArea/` - featured cars grid with search and sort functionality

## Data Flow
- HeroSection displays slider data from `heroConfig.js`
- CarArea manages search, sort, and car display functionality
- Redux integration for car data and search state management
- Each component uses its own config file for data and styling

## Template Structure
The home page follows the template exactly with:
1. Hero slider section with 3 slides
2. Car area with search/sort controls and car grid
All styling and content matches the original HTML template
